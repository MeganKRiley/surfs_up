# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
Analysis of the weather conditions in Hawaii to help determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a viable business opportunity. This analysis focuses on two months, June and December. 

### Results
    -The maximum temperature readings for June and December are 85 and 83 degrees, respectively.  These numbers show us that in regards to high temperatures, the summer months and the winter months have very similar weather. 
    -The minimum temperature readings for June and December are 64 and 56 degrees.  These numbers do show us that while it still gets very warm in the winter, it does tend to cool off quite a bit more than in the summer. 
    -The average temperature readings for June and December are 75 and 71 degrees.  These numbers are much more in line with the max temperature readings, which show very little difference in regards to time of year.

### Summary 
The analysis above tells us that for the most part, temperatures in Hawaii are pretty consistent throughout each season. To fully understand the weather as a whole we would want to look closely at the precipitation statistics during these time frames as well. Even if there aren't huge differences in temperature, there still could be differences in other ways.  I would also like to use queries to narrow down the stations closest to the prospective business locations.  Weather on islands can vary dramatically from area to area, so we would want to make sure we've really pinned down the location.
